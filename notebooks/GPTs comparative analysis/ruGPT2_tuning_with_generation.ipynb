Конечно, работа в морском ведомстве у Щенко была тяжелая и не всегда довольно плодотворная.

Многие уже ушли в море с командования и сейчас воюют. Это я уже знал, когда стал начальником. Как это ни удивительно, но мое отношение к Щенко было именно в этой сфере».\n",

И с той минуты, как я наконец почувствовал, что засыпаю, не было других мыслей об этом периоде. Она просто происходила с того времени, когда я на некоторое время уснул, спали мои двойники-декабристы.

Но если она уехала с Гатчины, значит, она сделала что-то чрезвычайно серьезное, даже непоправимое, - она должна была помочь ему. И если бы у нее хватило бы мужества остаться, она непременно оставила бы его здесь, в Алексеевском саду, и пошла бы к нему навстречу со слезами на глазах. \"Не надо, Господи, - она сказала бы мне, - не надо\". Она сказала бы \"Не хочу, Господи!\" - но ее нельзя было отпустить. Когда я проснулся, я был просто один. Единственное, что омрачало картину, была Нина Михайловна.

В семнадцатом году Кадман переехал в Берлин, где стал домоправителем молодой семьи, потом как раз занялся домом для немецких студентов. Через год после переезда он женился на Гансе фон Сиендорф, известной как Фрида. Кадман окончил мастерскую Гюмюка, в которой и получил новую специальность.\n",

Тогда каждая группа имела свой или иной доход, и все делились на небольшие группы по 20 - 30 штук. Находились и те, кто не хотел работать и только подписывался на гербовые письма. Если хотели мы - мы подписывались; если хотели мы - мы подписывались. После шестисот лет молчания каждый человек писал или писал, а мы подписывались», - рассказывает фон Сиендорф.\n",

            "А мысль эта безумно пугала Ипполита Михайловича, как сама мысль о том, что он напишет в гимназии новый памятник Пушкину. Он от себя не отказывался - его решение было твердым, он отдавал свои силы науке, любил ее. Особенно часто отдался он ее стихам и творениям к концу сороковых годов. Романтика этих стихов возбудила у него такую ярость, что он решил объявить Ипполиту Михайловичу выговор за вымогательство денег. Тут все и началось. Однажды жена его сказала ему, что у Ипполита Михайловича просят благословения, дарят ему отчизну и обвиняют в том, что он вместе с женой подложил пистолет под завалинку Таганки. Весь разговор Ипполита Михайловича с женой так прост, что читатель его не поймёт, как легко он за все это ухватился. Упреки его приняли большое хождение в войсках, особенно когда пришло известие о смерти любимого учителя. Он прочитал эту весть: \"Из живота отца моего исчезло все нечистоты и все, что только могло быть нечистого, и я могу теперь спокойно запеть на могиле своего учителя. Напрасно мы не видели его страдания. Теперь он пришел в себя и, может быть, каким-нибудь легким движением может дать нам то направление, в котором мы направляем свои искания\".\n",
            "\n",
            "По этой-то дороге в литературу Ипполита Михайловича за то время, которое он прожил с Григорием Александровичем Успенским, лучше не ступать. Он этого не выдерживает и мечтает о своем. В \"Небесах\" он \"помянул и восхвалил батюшку\" и искренне просит не забывать о его обязанностях. Он нуждается в постоянном попечении о нём. Он подрывной романтик и ревнивец. Но и не о том, чего просишь, а о том, что просишь. Он не может отказаться от исполнения всего, что должно быть им поставлено. \"Выехав на середину Варшавы, - писал он в Варшаву, - я направился к моему игумену, и они, подхалимы, облобызали меня.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Ну, что вы? - спросил я, похлопывая его, как прежде Лукаша.\n",

            "- Нет, голубчик, - ответил он, - не вы слышите, а сами думаете: \"Вот бы его найти и пощадить\".\n",
            "\n",
            "- Так напрасно! Этот негодяй не может попасться ни к черту. Неужели вы думаете, что я верчусь около него, когда ему нужно иметь место быть кому-нибудь обязанным? Он еще хуже большевиков, чем они!\n",
            "\n",
            "Он стал перед игуменом и тихо, проникновенно, горячо произнес:\n",
